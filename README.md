The following algorithm designed to enhance password security by employing multiple encryption techniques. This project combines innovation, technical proficiency, and real-world application to tackle one of todayâ€™s most pressing cyber-security challenges.


Key Features:
Multiple Encryption Techniques: Utilizes AES, RSA, ChaCha20, and Twofish encryption methods to provide layered security, making it extremely difficult for attackers to crack.

Dynamic Encryption: Randomly encrypts segments of the password using different methods, adding an extra layer of unpredictability and security.

Salt and Hash: Adds a secure random salt and hashes the salted password using SHA-256, ensuring each password has a unique hash.

Regular Scheme Updates: Periodically updates the encryption scheme and keys, reducing the risk of prolonged exposure to vulnerabilities.

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Simulation: Incorporates a lockout mechanism after several incorrect decryption attempts, simulating MFA integration for added security.

Audit Logging: Logs encryption events for auditing purposes, providing a detailed trail for security reviews.


WORKFLOW BY LAYERS

Layer 1: Input Layer
Password Input: The user inputs their password into the system.

Layer 2: Pre-Processing Layer
Salting and Hashing: The system adds a unique salt to the password and hashes it using SHA-256 to ensure uniqueness and security.

Layer 3: Machine Learning Layer
Dynamic Method Selection: The trained machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest Classifier) predicts the most suitable encryption method based on features like segment length, data type, and previous success.

Layer 4: Encryption Layer
Segment Encryption: The password is split into segments. Each segment is then encrypted using the method selected by the machine learning model (AES, RSA, ChaCha20, or Twofish).

Layer 5: Anomaly Detection Layer
Proactive Threat Detection: The system continuously monitors for anomalies, detecting suspicious activities such as unusual login attempts or multiple failed decryption attempts.
Automated Response: Upon detecting a threat, the system can automatically lock accounts, require additional authentication, or prompt users to reset their passwords.

Layer 6: Key Management Layer
Secure Key Generation: Cryptographic keys for AES, ChaCha20, and Twofish are securely generated.
Regular Scheme Updates: The system periodically updates encryption schemes and keys to maintain robust security.

Layer 7: Audit Logging Layer
Detailed Audit Logs: All encryption and decryption events are logged for auditing and compliance purposes.


Benefits:
Enhanced Security: Multiple layers of encryption and regular updates make the system robust against attacks.

User-Friendly: Allows users to create simple passwords while the AI handles the complex encryption, reducing the need for frequent password changes.

Proactive Threat Detection: Real-time monitoring and lockout mechanisms help prevent breaches before they occur.

Regulatory Compliance: Advanced encryption measures help businesses meet data protection regulations.

Trust and Reputation: Demonstrates a commitment to security, enhancing customer trust and providing a competitive advantage.
