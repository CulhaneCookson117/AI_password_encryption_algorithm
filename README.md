The following algorithm designed to enhance password security by employing multiple encryption techniques. This project combines innovation, technical proficiency, and real-world application to tackle one of todayâ€™s most pressing cyber-security challenges.

Key Features:
Multiple Encryption Techniques: Utilizes AES, RSA, DES, and Blowfish encryption methods to provide layered security, making it extremely difficult for attackers to crack.

Dynamic Encryption: Randomly encrypts segments of the password using different methods, adding an extra layer of unpredictability and security.

Salt and Hash: Adds a secure random salt and hashes the salted password using SHA-256, ensuring each password has a unique hash.

Regular Scheme Updates: Periodically updates the encryption scheme and keys, reducing the risk of prolonged exposure to vulnerabilities.

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Simulation: Incorporates a lockout mechanism after several incorrect decryption attempts, simulating MFA integration for added security.

Audit Logging: Logs encryption events for auditing purposes, providing a detailed trail for security reviews.

Benefits:
Enhanced Security: Multiple layers of encryption and regular updates make the system robust against attacks.

User-Friendly: Allows users to create simple passwords while the AI handles the complex encryption, reducing the need for frequent password changes.

Proactive Threat Detection: Real-time monitoring and lockout mechanisms help prevent breaches before they occur.

Regulatory Compliance: Advanced encryption measures help businesses meet data protection regulations.

Trust and Reputation: Demonstrates a commitment to security, enhancing customer trust and providing a competitive advantage.
